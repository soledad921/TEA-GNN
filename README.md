## Enviroment
Anaconda>=4.3.30
Python>=3.5
Keras>=2.2.4
Tensorflow>=1.13.1
Scipy
Numpy


## Datasets
Datasets include ICEWS05-15, YAGO-WIKI20K, YAGO-WIKI50K.

```
ent_ids_1: ids for entities in source KG;
ent_ids_2: ids for entities in target KG;
ref_ent_ids: entity links encoded by ids;
triples_1: relation triples encoded by ids in source KG;
triples_2: relation triples encoded by ids in target KG;
rel_ids_1: ids for entities in source KG;
rel_ids_2: ids for entities in target KG;
sup_pairs + ref_pairs: entity alignments
```

## Usage:
To reproduce the reported results of our models, use the following command:

```
python main.py --data ICEWS05-15 --seed 200 --gamma 3 --dim 100
```

'seed' denotes the number of pre-aligned entity pairs
'gamma' denotes the margin used in the loss function
'dim' denotes the embedding dimension

Please refer to the hyperparamters listed in the paper for reproducing the reported results. Since TEA-GNN significantly outperforms other baseline models, it is acceptable that the results fluctuate a little bit (Â±1%) when running code repeatedly due to the instability of embedding-based methods.
